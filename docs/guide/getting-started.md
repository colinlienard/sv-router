# Getting Started

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must be using Svelte 5 in order to use this router.

Run the following command to install the package:

::: code-group

```sh [npm]
npm install sv-router
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm add sv-router
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn add sv-router
```

```sh [bun]
bun add sv-router
```

## Setup

Now you have to choose between **code-based** or **file-based** routing:

- With code-based routing, you'll have more control over the way you architect your files, but you'll have to manually define the routes. [Setup code-based routing here](./code-based/setup).
- With file-based routing, you'll have to follow a specific file structure, but the routes mapping will be automatically generated. [Setup file-based routing here](./file-based/setup).
