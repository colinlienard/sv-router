# Getting Started

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> sv-router requires Svelte 5 to function properly.

Install the package using your preferred package manager:

## Setup

Choose between two routing approaches:

- **Code-based routing**: Offers greater control over your file architecture but requires manual route definition. [Set up code-based routing here](./code-based/setup).
- **File-based routing**: Automatically generates route mappings based on a specific file structure. [Set up file-based routing here](./file-based/setup).
