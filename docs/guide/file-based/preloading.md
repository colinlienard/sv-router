# Preloading

Preloading loads the next page in the background while users interact with the current page. This technique can reduce perceived loading times when users navigate to the preloaded page.

For preloading to work effectively, you must first implement code splitting for the route you want to preload. See [code splitting](./code-splitting.md).

## On Links

Simply add a `data-preload` attribute to the link that triggers navigation:

```svelte
<a href={p('/about')} data-preload>About</a>
```

When users hover over this link, the About page component will begin loading in the background, ensuring it's ready (or nearly ready) by the time they click.

## Programmatically

You can also preload a route programmatically with the `preload` function:

```ts
import { preload } from 'sv-router/generated';

await preload('/about');
```

## The `onPreload` Hook

The `onPreload` hook is called when the corresponding route is preloaded. It can be used to perform any necessary setup or initialization before the route is loaded, for example to fetch data that will then be used on the route. See [hooks](./hooks).
